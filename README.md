The review begins with an overview of the fundamental principles underlying CFD, highlighting its mathematical foundations and numerical techniques. It then delves into the diverse range of applications where CFD has been extensively employed, including aerodynamics, heat transfer, combustion, multiphase flows, and biofluid dynamics. Through an analysis of primary resources, this research aims to uncover the specific challenges faced in each application domain and the innovative solutions proposed by researchers.

Furthermore, the study examines the role of high-performance computing (HPC) and parallel algorithms in enhancing the efficiency and scalability of CFD simulations. As primary resources often provide detailed insights into the computational methodologies used in influential studies, this review will shed light on the computational strategies employed to tackle complex fluid dynamics problems.

The integration of machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques into CFD is also explored as a promising avenue for accelerating simulations, optimizing designs, and extracting valuable insights from vast datasets. The review critically assesses the impact of these intelligent approaches on the accuracy and speed of CFD simulations, drawing from primary resources that showcase successful implementations.

Additionally, the research investigates the current state of validation and verification practices in CFD studies, emphasizing the importance of benchmarking against experimental data and real-world scenarios. The use of primary resources allows for an in-depth evaluation of the reliability and robustness of CFD models, ensuring that simulations accurately represent physical phenomena.

In conclusion, this research provides a comprehensive and up-to-date review of the advancements in Computational Fluid Dynamics, leveraging insights from primary resources. By synthesizing information from influential publications, the study aims to offer a valuable resource for researchers, engineers, and practitioners in the field, facilitating a deeper understanding of CFD methodologies, challenges, and future directions.
